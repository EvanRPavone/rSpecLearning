# [RSpec Learning on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/)
This is from the [Testing Ruby with RSpec: The Complete Guide on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/)

primarily a personal repo to keep my notes on the course

Make sure you have RSpec Installed

To run a test
```
  rspec '.\spec\Section <Whatever> - <Whatever>\<whatever>_spec.rb'
```
